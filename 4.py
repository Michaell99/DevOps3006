first = 7
second = 44.3
result1 = first + second
result2 = first * second
result3 = second / first
#adding first and second together
print (result1)
#multiplying first and second together
print (result2)
#divide second and first together
print (result3)

#In question b a will end up as = 9, b will end up as = 8 and c will end up as = 15

# In question C there is no difference between the two lines they will output the same if printed.

#In question C part 2 the problem with the code is that the my_number is considered as as a integer and to fix it so it could work we shoudl write instead of 5+5 str(5+5)

#In question D the output will be 7

#Now for the challenge you just need tp change the print function to print (a+int(b))
